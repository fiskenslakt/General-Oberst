Discord Bot made with disco-py

This is a discord bot I hacked together to moderate one of my servers and to play around with a bunch of different API's.

## Features
* Auto apply server role to new users
* Store user generated tags
* Convert timezones
* Display weather
* Image manipulation
* Execute code in messages
* Display minecraft related info
* And more...
